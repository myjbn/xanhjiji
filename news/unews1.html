                    Many American consumers are now eligible to save thousands of dollars when they buy an electric car, heat pump, solar panels or energy-efficient appliances.
                </p>
                <p>   
                    Those savings kicked in this year as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, major legislation that aims to cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. The law tackles two major sources of those emissions, transportation and housing, in part by helping Americans electrify their cars and homes, and by making the most energy efficient choices more affordable through tax credits and rebates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taking advantage of the new law will require some planning, experts said, especially when it comes to major purchases and renovations. It helps that many of the benefits will be around for a decade or more, though not all of them are available just yet: Federal tax credits took effect on Jan. 1, but rebates, which will offer billions of dollars in up-front discounts or partial refunds to consumers through state and tribal governments, won’t roll out until later this year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here’s how to access the savings:
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>
                    Home Improvements
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you own your home, there are plenty of opportunities to save money through the new law when you make energy-saving renovations or upgrade to more efficient, electric appliances. Technically, many of the law’s provisions could apply to renters, too, but experts said there’s still some uncertainty about what is covered — for example, it isn’t clear right now whether the tax credits for heat pumps will apply to window units.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>
                    Get a home energy audit
                </h3>
                <p>A room by room walk-through to evaluate your home’s energy use, conducted by a licensed professional, can help identify where your house is losing energy, what you can do to save money on your bills and how to best make energy efficiency upgrades.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>
                    Install solar panels or other renewable energy options
                </h3>
                <p>
                    New clean energy technologies for your home, including rooftop solar panels, wind turbines and geothermal heat pumps, as well as standalone batteries to store electricity from renewable sources, qualify for tax credits.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Make energy-saving renovations and buy efficient appliances
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Purchases of highly energy-efficient home systems — including water heaters, central air conditioners and boilers — qualify for tax credits. So do energy-saving home improvements, like insulation, sealing air leaks and more energy-efficient exterior doors, windows and skylights.
                </p>
                <hr>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    A renewed tax credit can help lower the cost of a new electric car, pickup truck or SUV for many buyers. And, for the first time, used electric automobiles qualify for a credit, too. But if you’re looking for savings on other types of vehicles, like e-bikes or motorcycles, you’re out of luck.
                </p>

                    Buy a new electric car, pickup truck or SUV
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Save money when purchasing a new electric vehicle from a qualified manufacturer. To qualify, the vehicle must also be assembled in North America and manufacturers must meet certain requirements regarding the components of the vehicle’s battery and where its critical minerals were sourced.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Save when purchasing a used electric vehicle from a licensed car dealer. The vehicle must be at least two years old to qualify, but, unlike new electric vehicles, it does not have to be assembled in North America.
                </p>

                    More information on the Inflation Reduction Act’s consumer savings can be found through the White House, the I.R.S. and the United States Department of Energy. Other federal, state, local and utility savings may also be available for energy-efficiency projects and electric vehicle purchases.
